# FriendMap Social

This API is a backend application for a fictitious social networking application. FriendMap Social is an application that allows users to track their friends, share thoughts associated with their user accounts and have their friends post reactions to their shared thoughts. The API uses express nod package to handle its routing and the mongoose node package to as the Model Document Controller in its interfacing with the MongoDB.

This API will be tested using Insomnia and may be developed into a full-stack application in the future.
