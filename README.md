# FriendMap Social API

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Application Description 

This API is a backend application for a fictitious social networking application. FriendMap Social is an application that allows users to track their friends, share thoughts associated with their user accounts and have their friends post reactions to their shared thoughts. The API uses express nod package to handle its routing and the mongoose node package to as the Model Document Controller in its interfacing with the MongoDB.

This API will be tested using Insomnia and may be developed into a full-stack application in the future.

## Steps for Install
Because this is a back-end API application, it must be tested/used with [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to connect to the routes and the input of data into the database. In order to use the application, users will need to do a node package manager install, to install the dependencceis and then will need to install and use insomnia to test/run the routes.

## User Instructions
Check out the link to the tutorial link above and here is a screenshot of tests in Insomnia:
